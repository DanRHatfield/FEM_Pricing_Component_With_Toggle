## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- Control the toggle with both their mouse/trackpad and their keyboard

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I wasn't able to get the toggle to work with just CSS so will need to look further into that.
This was a great experience to learn about gradients and the changing of a checkbox into a toggle switch.
